# Theqa AI

Theqa AI is an advanced AI-powered platform.

## Architecture

This repository is set up as a monorepo with the following components:

- `apps/api`: The backend API, built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL** (via asyncpg), **SQLAlchemy**, and **Alembic** for migrations.
- `apps/web`: Next.js web client for the hackathon demo path (create deal → checkout → fund → confirm → release).

## Web app (premium fintech UI)

```bash
cd apps/web
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Ensure the API is running on port 8000.

### Demo path
1. Register as **Merchant**
2. Create a deal → copy checkout link
3. Register/login as **Individual** (buyer) → open checkout → Accept → Pay securely
4. Seller marks shipped → buyer confirms delivery → release funds
5. View release receipt

The UI connects only to the existing backend API. Theqa never holds funds — the licensed escrow partner (sandbox mock) does.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the Database

The project uses a PostgreSQL database. You can start it using Docker Compose from the root of the project:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a PostgreSQL container named `theqa_db` on port `5432`.

### 2. API Setup

Navigate to the API directory:

```bash
cd apps/api
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Database Migrations

With the database running and the virtual environment activated, apply the database migrations to set up your tables:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 4. Run the API Server

Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
You can access the interactive Swagger API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Health Check

To verify the API is running correctly, you can hit the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

## Features Implemented So Far

### 1. Authentication & Users (Phase 2)
- Secure user registration and login endpoints utilizing Argon2 password hashing.
- Organization support allowing users to be tied to `personal`, `merchant`, or `platform` organizations with specific roles.
- JWT-based Bearer token authentication to protect endpoints.

### 2. Trust Score Engine (Phase 3)
- **Piecewise Rule Engine**: A fully dynamic mathematical scoring algorithm to evaluate both individuals and merchants on an exact 0-100 scale using metrics like dispute rates, success percent, and account age. Includes rigorous cold-start priors (e.g. baseline 5% refund expectation for new merchants).
- **Asynchronous Execution**: The heavy trust mathematics run safely in the background (using FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`), preventing API blocking.
- **Signal Ingestion API**: An internal `/mock` endpoint to inject raw performance signals into the database, instantly triggering a background score recalculation.
- **Read-Only Score Fetching**: A blazingly fast `GET` endpoint that retrieves the pre-calculated final score and detailed breakdown straight from the database.

## How to Test the Application

The fastest way to test everything together is by using the interactive **FastAPI Swagger UI** provided out of the box.

### Step 1: Access Swagger UI
Make sure your server is running (`uvicorn app.main:app --reload`).
Open your browser and navigate to: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

### Step 2: Inject a Trust Signal
1. Scroll down to the **Trust** section and find the `POST /v1/trust/internal/trust-signals/mock` endpoint.
2. Click **"Try it out"**.
3. Enter the following JSON payload. This simulates a user getting their Identity Verified:
```json
{
  "entity_type": "individual",
  "entity_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "signal_type": "identity_verification",
  "value": 1.0,
  "metadata_payload": {
    "level": "verified"
  }
}
```
4. Click **Execute**. You should get a `201` response indicating the signal was ingested and recalculation queued.

### Step 3: View the Calculated Trust Score
1. In the Swagger UI, locate the `GET /v1/trust/scores/{type}/{id}` endpoint.
2. Click **"Try it out"**.
3. Set `type` to `individual`.
4. Set `id` to `3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6` (the same UUID you used above).
5. Click **Execute**. 

**Expected Result**: You should instantly receive a `200` response containing a computed `score` and a detailed JSON `breakdown`. Because you only verified their identity, the rest of their score components will automatically fall back to the cold-start baseline priors outlined in the Technical Blueprint (e.g., age=20, disputes=100)!

### Step 4: Test Creating and Accepting a Deal (Phase 4)
Make sure you are authenticated in Swagger UI (using the green Authorize button at the top) by creating a user (`POST /v1/auth/register`) and an organization (`POST /v1/auth/organizations`), then grabbing the Bearer token.

**1. Create a Deal (Seller Role)**
- Locate `POST /v1/deals` and execute it.
- **Payload:**
```json
{
  "org_id": "<your-organization-uuid>",
  "title": "Graphic Design Services",
  "description": "Logo design for the new startup",
  "amount": 500,
  "currency": "JOD",
  "fulfillment_mode": "standard",
  "fee_bps": 200,
  "fee_payer": "split"
}
```
- **Expected Output:** A `201` response with the Deal object. It will have a status of `draft`, and it will automatically generate a unique `public_code` (e.g., `ABC123XYZ`). Notice that `fee_amount` and `net_amount` are automatically computed, and you have been added as the `seller` participant.

**2. Fetch Deal via Public Code (Buyer Checking Out)**
- Locate `GET /v1/deals/by-code/{code}`. This endpoint does NOT require authentication.
- Provide the `public_code` generated in step 1.
- **Expected Output:** A `200` response showing the deal details. This is what powers the public checkout link before a buyer logs in.

**3. Accept the Deal (Buyer Role)**
- Authenticate as a completely **different user** in Swagger UI (using a new incognito window, or changing the Bearer token).
- Locate `POST /v1/deals/{id}/accept`.
- Provide the `id` of the deal.
- **Expected Output:** A `200` response. The State Machine automatically transitions the deal from `draft` to `awaiting_funding`. The new user is automatically attached as the `buyer_user_id` and added to the `participants` array. Furthermore, an immutable transition log is appended to the `events` array demonstrating the state change!

### Step 5: Test the Mock Licensed Provider (Phase 5)
Once the deal is in `awaiting_funding` and you are authenticated as the **buyer**, you can trigger the secure checkout.

**1. Create a Payment Intent**
- Locate `POST /v1/deals/{id}/payment-intents`.
- Paste the Deal `id` from step 4.
- In the `Idempotency-Key` header field, enter any random string (e.g. `test-key-123`).
- **Expected Output:** A `200` response containing a `provider_intent_id` (e.g., `mock_pi_xxxx`). 
- **What happens behind the scenes?** Because of our "Demo Speed Optimization", our Mock Licensed Provider securely simulates a successful bank transaction and *automatically* fires a background HTTP request to our internal webhook (`POST /v1/webhooks/mock-provider`) with an HMAC SHA-256 signature!

**2. Verify the Shadow Ledger and State Transition**
- Wait 1 second for the background webhook to process.
- Locate `GET /v1/deals/{id}`.
- Enter the Deal `id` and hit Execute.
- **Expected Output:** The deal's `status` has instantly transitioned to `"funded"`! If you check the `events` array, you will see a secure audit log showing the exact timestamp the State Machine moved the deal to funded. In the database, a double-entry `LedgerTransaction` has been safely appended to the shadow ledger, moving funds to the `provider_escrow_mirror`!
